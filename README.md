# Professional-Practises

## Effective time management
As this was our first real client we needed to make sure we came through and gave the client (ZSL) everything they wanted and more. We knew we needed to stick to a schedule and make sure we followed it down to even the smallest details. This was to make sure we provided our client with an app that was exatly what the needed and wanted. Additionally, the schedule helped us keep the professionalism of the project to the highest possible standard, as we knew what our client wanted so we designed a schedule to help better manage our time; to reduce the chance of us failing. We decided to go with a Gantt chart as we felt this type of chart/schedule would benefit us the most:

As you can see from the Gantt chart we outlined the first day we met with the client on the 2nd October; all the way to the 6th  of November where the game was ready to be shipped and given back to the ZSL. We had planend when we would begin and finish, the analysis (our first meeting), our Design documentation (which included story boards and project specifications), completing the proposal (the powerpoint we made to show ZSL our ideas and concept art for the game), the development of the app (such as the coding and finishing the graphics for the game) and finally the testing/finished stage (where we tested our game to be certain it worked and it met all of the requirements of the client). We were then proud and satisfied with our game are were ready to give it back.

## Problem solving techniques
One of the more important techniques we used to solve a problem was trial and error. We planned to set up a prototype demonstration of our game on the Ipads that ZSL provided so the staff could have a go at testing our game; this was very helpful as a few of them found bugs we had not come across yet. Additionally, they gave us feedback that we could use to alter our game; for example they felt we should focus more on the chain of the four habitats and how they affect the habitat rather than the gameplay of the game/app which we felt was a fair point. We had a few problems getting our app to open on the Ipads, which stunned us as we had no idea why it would not load, we tried closing and re-opening Unity (game developing platfrom) and disconnecting then re-connecting to the device's internet but nothing seemed to work. finally, due to trial and error we found that restarting the Ipad fixed the problem immediately. 

We used a few contingecy plans and had several back up plans to make sure our project went smoothly. We had 3 USB's that all had our presentation on; to prevent us not being able to present our powerpoint we had put together to demonstrate our ideas and concept art to ZSL. Additionally, we created a hand out that provided essential details that the ZSL staff could look through while we gave our presentation, this was to make sure they would have something to look at, at their own speed; and as a contingency plan just incase thier premises' computer malfunctioned and it prevented us from presentating.

We occured another problem at the start of our presentation that happend to be with the powerpoint. Even though we had revised every possible problem with our contigency plans, which i spoke about in my last paragraph; we did not consider the computer we were going to be using to be faulty. When we inserted our USB the computer did not seem to recongize the USB, we decided to breakdown our problem and thought if every USB we are trying does not seem to work, but they have before it must be the computer. After consulting ZSL they agreed that the computers USB ports must be faulty, and after a few minutes they provided us with another computer.

## Critical reasoning
At the beginning of development we planned to have the player control an animal within a habitat (the animal will match the habitat, for example a snow wolf in the antartic), which they would be helping escape from a maze; if they successfully escaped with their animal the green house gas meter on the right side of the screen would decrease in size, to show the player they were helping the environment (this would be the same with each of the four habitats we had designed.) After our presentation with ZSL they decided they loved the idea of the player being able to interact with the animal and see that they are doing something to help the environment. Although they liked our ideas they would like to game play to focus more on the chain of the habitat and how that affects the habitat. We used critical reasoning and brain storming to help us come up with the idea to scrap our whole idea, but keep the concept art and graphics but have the chain displayed on the screen to the user, and have them drag and drop the correct stage of the chain one by one. We felt it was necessary to give the player the first and last stage just as a helping hand. We sent emails to ZSL which contained our ideas and they agreed it was a betetr idea and were excited to see how the game would turn out.
