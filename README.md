# Professional-Practises

## Effective time management
As this was our first real client we needed to make sure we came through and gave the client (ZSL) everything they wanted and more. We knew we needed to stick to a schedule and make sure we followed it down to even the smallest details. This was to make sure we provided our client with an app that was exatly what the needed and wanted. Additionally, the schedule helped us keep the professionalism of the project to the highest possible standard, as we knew what our client wanted so we designed a schedule to help better manage our time; to reduce the chance of us failing. We decided to go with a Gantt chart as we felt this type of chart/schedule would benefit us the most:

As you can see from the Gantt chart we outlined the first day we met with the client on the 2nd October; all the way to the 6th  of November where the game was ready to be shipped and given back to the ZSL. We had planend when we would begin and finish, the analysis (our first meeting), our Design documentation (which included story boards and project specifications), completing the proposal (the powerpoint we made to show ZSL our ideas and concept art for the game), the development of the app (such as the coding and finishing the graphics for the game) and finally the testing/finished stage (where we tested our game to be certain it worked and it met all of the requirements of the client). We were then proud and satisfied with our game are were ready to give it back.

## Problem solving techniques
One of the more important techniques we used to solve a problem was trial and error. We planned to set up a prototype demonstration of our game on the Ipads that ZSL provided so the staff could have a go at testing our game; this was very helpful as a few of them found bugs we had not come across yet. Additionally, they gave us feedback that we could use to alter our game; for example they felt we should focus more on the chain of the four habitats and how they affect the habitat rather than the gameplay of the game/app which we felt was a fair point. We had a few problems getting our app to open on the Ipads, which stunned us as we had no idea why it would not load, we tried closing and re-opening Unity (game developing platfrom) and disconnecting then re-connecting to the device's internet but nothing seemed to work. finally, due to trial and error we found that restarting the Ipad fixed the problem immediately. 

We used a few contingecy plans and had several back up plans to make sure our project went smoothly. We had 3 USB's that all had our presentation on; to prevent us not being able to present our powerpoint we had put together to demonstrate our ideas and concept art to ZSL. Additionally, we created a hand out that provided essential details that the ZSL staff could look through while we gave our presentation, this was to make sure they would have something to look at, at their own speed; and as a contingency plan just incase thier premises' computer malfunctioned and it prevented us from presentating.

We occured another problem at the start of our presentation that happend to be with the powerpoint. Even though we had revised every possible problem with our contigency plans, which i spoke about in my last paragraph; we did not consider the computer we were going to be using to be faulty. When we inserted our USB the computer did not seem to recongize the USB, we decided to breakdown our problem and thought if every USB we are trying does not seem to work, but they have before it must be the computer. After consulting ZSL they agreed that the computers USB ports must be faulty, and after a few minutes they provided us with another computer.

## Critical reasoning
At the beginning of development we planned to have the player control an animal within a habitat (the animal will match the habitat, for example a snow wolf in the antartic), which they would be helping escape from a maze; if they successfully escaped with their animal the green house gas meter on the right side of the screen would decrease in size, to show the player they were helping the environment (this would be the same with each of the four habitats we had designed.) After our presentation with ZSL they decided they loved the idea of the player being able to interact with the animal and see that they are doing something to help the environment. Although they liked our ideas they would like to game play to focus more on the chain of the habitat and how that affects the habitat. We used critical reasoning and brain storming to help us come up with the idea to scrap our whole idea, but keep the concept art and graphics but have the chain displayed on the screen to the user, and have them drag and drop the correct stage of the chain one by one. We felt it was necessary to give the player the first and last stage just as a helping hand. We sent emails to ZSL which contained our ideas and they agreed it was a betetr idea and were excited to see how the game would turn out. Here is an image of our game before and after our feedback to demonstrate how drastically we changed our game:

## Importance of team dynamics
When it comes to projects, team dynamics are the main reason for success or failure. An easy team dynamic to consider is relationships between project members. Within any projects there are going to be different types of relationships, this can vary from long time friends, people newly acquainted, boss', collegues, your spoose and even people that dislike each other. When it comes to the success of any project, the team needs to know each others strengths and weaknesses to make sure each member of the team is assinged a role that they are comfortable with, good at and which is going to benefit the team and the project the most. Additionally, if the team know each other well, get along very well and are all comfortable working with each other then there should be no problems when it comes to clashing of personailities. On the other hand if members of the team cant stand working with each other or have fallen out in the past and proven they do not work well together, if thats because they have completely different personailities which clash or because they are not good and coming together as a team; the other members and the project as a whole will most likely fail. 

If employees enjoy their work, can also be considered a team dynamic. If people do not like their job they arent going to put 100% effort into to projects and work in general. This can have huge affects on projects as for example if a team member is given the job to design the concept art for a game or app, and this member happens to not like their job; their designs are going to reflect that in the sense that they arent going to be as professional and high quality as they could be, possibly resulting in the failure of the project. Additionally, if they do not like their job they are more likely to miss days resulting in them missing valuable information that is essentail to them completing their work. On the other hand if every member of the group loves coming to work, and never misses a day the quality and success of the group/project is going to reflect that; as each member will know what they're doing and will be putting 110% in with everything they do, increasing the chance of success. Another team dynamic that relates to wanting to work, is enthusiasm. If someone is not engaged or enthusiastic to work, they group is going to be affected heavily; this can also bring down other members moods and enthusiastic levels. Again if it is the other way round, for example everyone in the group is excited, enthusiastic and enjoys the work, the group and project as a whole are going to benefit in a very positive way.

Team dynamics are essential when it comes to the failure and success of any project. They can drastically affect the quality of work, overall mood of the group, and determine the outcome of the project, like whether it is going to succeed or fail.

## Working in a team to achieve a defined goal
To answer this I am going to speak about my team within our ZSL project. ZSL approached us and wanted us to design and develop a game/app that they would use to help with teaching and keeping the children more engaged. They did not have a game/app that they felt supported them enough while they were teaching their lessons and this is why they wanted us to develop a game/app they could use to help them teach their lesson and keep the children more engaged and interested. The game would be based around 4 different greenhouse gas product chains: Plastic bottles, Mobile phones, Beef, and Electronics being left on standby such as TVs. My team consisted on Me who mainly focused on ideas and design concepts, Mark Biswell who focused on the documentation whilst also inputing ideas, Ryan Edwards who also would also focused on the presentation and Sam Pearce who focused on bringing our concept ideas to life in photoshop.

Aims and Objectives:

Our aims of the project were to create a fun, educational, interactive game that also made the children think about global warming and what they can do in their day to day lives to help reduce this global threat. Again we are going to take a look at the Gantt chart we made for this project to identify the objectives we set out to achieve from the beginning. 

![](https://gyazo.com/4387ac84cc3c6065d0e073f7910b5f85.png)

As you can see from the chart we had outlined all the dates we wanted to be finished with certain aspects of the project. To give a few objectives we all wanted to achieve together were the big milestones all outlined in red. These milestones/objectives were to have all of our design documentation completed by Monday the 16th of October. This milestone consisted of mine milestones like creating storyboards, flow charts, researching and creating our concept art and finally making sure we all fully understood the project specifications and had them documented. The next milestone was to have all of our presentation/proposal documentation fully complete, this consisted of creating the power point, writing up a script and creating the handouts for ZSL. The next milestone was to have the development of the actuall game all done; again this consisted of finalising all of our graphics of the game, the basic code of the game to be working and making sure all of the scenes of the game were connected. Lastly, the most important milestone was the testing and shipping milestone, this consisted of testing everything within our game to make sure there were no bugs and everything worked how it should, this wiuld lead us to being ready to ship the game back to ZSL.

## The importance of CPD
CPD stands for Continuing Professional Development, this means to deliberately maintain or develop skills and/or knowledge of a hobby, job, professional standard and anything that leads to you improving skills and/or knowledge. A good business will always be evolving and improving and CPD is a huge part of that. Take a doctor as an example; 10 years ago medicines, techniques, equipment and medical training would be drastically different to what they are now and for a doctor to be the best doctor they possibly can they're going to need to maintain, improve or develop their skills and/or knowledge. CPD is imporant when it comes to self learning for a couple reasons. One of them reasons being it gives employees a clear path to success within their profession. If they are constantly using CPD to get better they are going to succeed a lot more in that job role than someone who does not want to improve on their skills or knowledge. Leading off of this CPD can increase ones confidence. If someone is getting better at whatever they are doing, there mood, health and self loving/confidence is going to see a dramatic change for the better; as they are going to be improving themselves as a whole. Additionally, there are many ways one can actively improve these come in the form of online tutorials where users can improve at their own pace, or if thats at a work shop at their place of work improving and maintainign together.
