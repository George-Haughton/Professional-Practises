## Effective time management
As this was our first real client we needed to make sure we came through and gave the client (ZSL) everything they wanted and more. We knew we needed to stick to a schedule and make sure we followed it down to even the smallest details. This was to make sure we provided our client with an app that was exatly what the needed and wanted. Additionally, the schedule helped us keep the professionalism of the project to the highest possible standard, as we knew what our client wanted so we designed a schedule to help better manage our time; to reduce the chance of us failing. We decided to go with a Gantt chart as we felt this type of chart/schedule would benefit us the most:

As you can see from the Gantt chart we outlined the first day we met with the client on the 2nd October all the way to the 6th  of November where the game was ready to be shipped and given back to the ZSL. We had planend when we would begin and finish, the analysis (our first meeting), our Design documentation (which included story boards and project specifications), completing the proposal (the powerpoint we made to show ZSL our ideas and concept art for the game), the development of the app (such as the coding and finishing the graphics for the game) and finally the testing/finished stage (where we tested our game to be certain it worked and it met all of the requirements of the client). We were then proud and satisfied with our game are were ready to give it back.
